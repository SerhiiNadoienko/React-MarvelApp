# React-MarvelApp

## **Description**

The application receives data from the official [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/)

At first, the application was written on a class approach, but later it was rewritten on a functional one.

**Opportunities**

- Getting a random character
- Switching tabs of characters and comics
- Pagination of data
- Getting a list of comics by clicking on a character
- Ð¡lick on the comic for full details

### **Details**

- I wrote my own hook for convenient getting data.
- All interaction with the server and data transformation takes place in a separate file.
- For navigation I used the **React Router Dom v6**.
- For smooth pagination I used **React Transition Group**.
- To speed up the application, I used **React.Lazy**.
- I used **react-helmet** for Seo optimization and meta-data customization
